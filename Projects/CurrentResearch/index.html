				<p id="text">How are humans able to distinguish between classical music and hip hop so quickly and efficiently? As has been emphasized by many ethnomusicologists, categorization has a huge social context to it, but we are able to reliably distinguish different forms of music. What are the elements into this categorization or genre-making? Is it the music itself? The vocals? The instrumentation? The lyrics? Is it knowing who is performing (thus bringing up questions of gender, race, etc). By focusing on Soul and R&B music in the 1970s and 1980s, I will be breaking down the elements of how we distinguish music. My initial research will be posted soon! The goal is to create a program (most likely a neural network) that can distinguish between popular songs from the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
