				<h2>First blog post!</h2>
				<p>Hey guys! How exciting is this? I'm starting a little blog. My motivation behind this is to share my progress in all of my projects. Hopefully, this will help show my process through solving various problems.<br><br>So...to start off this whole update thing: I have finally posted all the projects that I am currently working on! You can check it out in the Projects section. Currently, I am working on an Android and iPhone music app, sea level simulations, other websites, and a massive research project analyzing the way in which we divide music into genres. As I work on these, I'll post updates!<br><br>Over the next couple of days, I will post my current status on all of my projects, starting with Avec (I know you have all been waiting with bated breath).<br><br>Oh! Get ready for weekly playlists as well. Obviously, I have to listen to lots of music while I work on all these projects!<br><br>I'll work on adding a comment section for blog posts soon as well. Bye for now!<br><br>P.S. I realize I sound way too enthusiastic in this post. Sorry not sorry I get excited about working on cool things. <br><br>Posted on: 11/5/2014</p>
